# Drum-Kit

# Description
The Drum Kit application allows users to play different drum sounds either by clicking on the drum buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each drum button is associated with a specific sound and key, and when activated, it triggers an animation to enhance the user experience. This project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging advanced DOM manipulation techniques.
